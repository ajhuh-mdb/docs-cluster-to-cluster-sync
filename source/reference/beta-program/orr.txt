Starting in {+c2c-beta-program-short+} 1.8, you can enable Oplog Rollover 
Resilience (ORR). With ORR,  ``mongosync`` applies changes made on the source 
cluster to the destination cluster during the initial sync.

By applying changes earlier in the sync process, ``mongosync`` maintains a more 
recent position in the :term:`oplog`. This adds resilience to long-running 
operations, mitigates the risk of oplog rollover, and significantly lowers 
the risk of restarting the sync.

Syntax 
------

To enable ORR, use ``--oplogRolloverResilienceIntervalSeconds``and specify the 
interval, in seconds, in which ``mongosync`` checks for eligible change events 
in the oplog. The default value is ``-1``, which disables the option.

For example, to start ``mongosync`` with the 
``oplogRolloverResilienceIntervalSeconds`` set to ``60`` seconds, run the 
following command: 

.. code-block:: shell 
   :copyable: false

   ./bin/mongosync \
         --cluster0 "mongodb://localhost:27000" \
         --cluster1 "mongodb://localhost:27001" \
         --oplogRolloverResilienceIntervalSeconds 60

Behavior 
--------

ORR increases the resilience of ``mongosync`` to oplog rollover but does not 
prevent rollover entirely.

You might exceed the :term:`oplog window` if you: 

- Sync from a high write rate source cluster for an extended
  period.
- Pause sync for an extended period.

To increase the size of the oplog on the source cluster, use
:setting:`~replication.oplogSizeMB`.
