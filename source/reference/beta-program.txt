To request access to the ``mongosync-beta`` binaries, please file a 
`HELP ticket <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/HELP>`_.

.. warning:: Disclaimer

   MongoDB restricts access to beta features via the beta build. Your use of the 
   beta is governed by the language specified in the 
   `Cloud Subscription Agreement <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud-subscription-agreement/november-2023>`_, 
   `Cloud Terms of Service <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/cloud>`_, 
   or other applicable agreement between you and MongoDB with respect to your 
   use of ``mongosync``.
   
   You understand that features are available through the beta build, and flags 
   are not generally available. All use of beta builds is at your own risk. 
   Beta builds provide no stability guarantees; API, UI, options, and behaviors 
   may change or be removed any time. MongoDB will never issue a Critical 
   Advisory or notify about defects in beta builds. 
   
   You should follow feature usage guidance provided by Field and R&D without 
   deviation and should only use beta builds for one-time, human-supervised 
   migrations (e.g., not for continuous sync or automated migrations). Beta 
   capabilities are not intended for use to migrate production workloads.
