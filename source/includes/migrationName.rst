Starting in {+c2c-beta-program-short+} 1.8, you can specify a ``migrationName`` 
to describe a sync operation. For example, you can set ``migrationName`` to 
distinguish and identify different sync operations when working with 
:ref:`Many-to-One <c2c-beta-many-to-one>` or :ref:`A->B->C 
<c2c-beta-abc-migration>` migrations.
